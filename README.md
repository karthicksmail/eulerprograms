# Purpose of the repo
My version of solutions for the programs at [Project Euler][https://projecteuler.net/]. I know that they ask people not to post the answers. But I figured that if someone is serious about programming, then they would not resort to lowly methods like copying others code. If a person copies, then that person is the loser!
Currently, the solutions are in Java.
